"""
Letâ€™s start with a very simple file of words taken from the text of Romeo and 
Juliet. (romeo.txt)

We will write a Python program to read through the lines of the file, break 
each line into a list of words, and then loop through each of the words in 
the line, and count each word using a dictionary.
